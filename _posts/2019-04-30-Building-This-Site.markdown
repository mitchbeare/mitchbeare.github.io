Learning to develop I have been told frequently that I should begin building a portfolio that in future can be reference for my accomplishments.
Brainstorming on what I should do to rememdy this I decided why don't I build something showcase worthy!

To host this site I am making use to github's <a href="https://pages.github.com/">pages</a> service. To obtain my custom URL I quickly hopped over to <a href="https://domains.google/#/">Google Domains </a> and setup my custom hostname.
After that quick 10 minutes of work I was there, I had a site that was live on the internet now to populate it.

Modern websites tend to be dynamic in nature running some form of web technology to handle the majority of their content creation, Angular, Ruby on Rails, Yii, Django the list goes on.
But I had a problem due to the nature of github pages I had no real ability to install or configure these technolgies on the server so they were off of the board.
I know some basic javascript so I could try to build the baseplate from scratch myself. But that would take an extremely long time and I wanted SOMETHING to show off for potential employers ASAP.

Reading through github's documentation, that is when I noticed it supported Jekyll for dynamic content generation. Saved! Flicking through Jekyll's documentation it all seemed pretty simple I still had some templating to complete and basic JS + CSS to get in place to make things pretty but I had SOMETHING that was keeping me from writing every single line as plain HTML.

So here we are, after an afternoon of playing I have this site built using a Jekyll backend, CSS/JS markup for the pretty visuals on the front. Maybe someday I would get some time to make some pretty animations and really show off some Javascript but for now I have a platform where I can do what I want show off and look cool in the process.
