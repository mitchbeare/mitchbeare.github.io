  This project was built in c++ std17. In Visual Studio 2017. I did not use any outside tools or libraries.

      After a long series of moving office and settling into a new area I found myself with something odd, a free Sunday!<br>
      In my study we have never touched c++, it has always been talked about as the genesis of C and the jumping on point for       modern computing. But touted as horrible to work with and not worth the time.<br>

      Unfortunately for me I am endlessly curious so I did some googling and followed a few Hello World! tutorials on youtube,       interesting but I didn't see many differences yet. No I need a project of some kind. When I was a kid we used to play <a       href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows" Bulls and Cows<a> on a piece of paper to see who could come up with       words the other just couldn't get. <br>
